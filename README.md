- Bitcoin price data is fetched, as default, from [coinmarketcap](https://www.coinmarketcap.com) which returns limited amount of data points. Specify different `source` (like [coincompare](https://www.cryptocompare.com/)) with relative `api_key` to fetch the whole historical dataset from the specified source.
- Cycles are computed considering _past halving dates_ and the _expected future halving date_ fetched from [watchguru](https://watcher.guru/bitcoin-halving)
